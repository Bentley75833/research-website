        <p class="description">
            385mg valeriana officinalis L. - equal to 1.5-2g of root<br><br>

            <span class = "timestamp">10:20</span><br><br>
            
            packed a bowl with some bud and as much root powder as i could fit in<br><br>
            
            <span class = "timestamp">10:28</span><br><br>
            finished smoking bowl<br>
            took quite a while as i packed it dense to fit as much as i could in<br> 
            at the start when first lit it solidified into a rock<br> 
            produced a lot of vapour as in kept re lightning<br> 
            feel slightly slow but no noticeable effects<br> 
            more attention to detail<br> 
            can’t stop staring at one weird patch in the floor<br><br>
            
            vision is kinda darting a bit<br>
            peripherial vision starting to look. a bit psycelic and blurry<br> 
            hungry for som reason ? even tho i just had a massive dinner and was extreme full<br> 
            legs deffo feel a bit glonky like<br>
            jelly<br><br> 
            
            <span class = "timestamp">10:34</span><br><br>
            
            second bowl<br><br>
            
            <span class = "timestamp">10:42</span><br><br>
            
            finished second bowl and having a piss now<br> 
            legs feel a bit sedated, much like a benzo<br>
            colours seen very sharp and pleasant<br> 
            always have urge to sway my hips when typing<br><br> 
            
            mild psycadelic hallucinations inin the periphery<br> 
            sort of like low dose mushrooms<br> 
            a bit of dissociation<br> 
            feel like i’m on autopilot sort thing<br> 
            like look at my hands in the first person<br><br> 
             
            
            <span class = "timestamp">10:49</span><br><br>
            
            walking up stairs to bed<br>
            yeah this is def psychedlic<br>
            carpet was looking max<br>
            breathing and moving<br> 
            and looked like it was becoming more 3d as in every one of the little particles<br><br>
            
            legs deffo feel harder to move<br><br> 
            
            <span class = "timestamp">11:00</span><br><br>
            
            playin some dew<br>
            hands a bit shaky<br> 
            eyes kinda hurt but not in a bad way<br><br>
            
            <span class = "timestamp">11:13</span><br><br>
            
            feel heavily physically sedated now<br> 
            in bed<br> 
            very week closed eye visuals<br> 
            sort of like distant speckles of light making up faces and such<br> 
            mouth keeps getting very dry even with drinking water<br> 
            
            eyes still a bit darty, hard to focus on words to read<br><br>
            
            <span class = "timestamp">12:39</span><br><br>
            
            euphoric effects have mainly wore off now<br> 
            still heavily sedated<br>
            will probs go to sleep now<br>
