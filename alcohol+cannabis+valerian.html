            Alcohol + Cannabis + Valerian Root Extract
        </h2>
        <p class="description">
            Alcohol + THC (water bong) + Valerian Root Extract<br><br>

            alcohol = numerous cocktails and pints <br><br>


            <span class="timestamp">8:00</span>am- 100mg modafinil<br> 
            <span class="timestamp">1:30</span>pm 100mg modafnil<br> 
            thc - bong <span class="timestamp">8:00</span>pm<br>
            before going out<br> 
            had with strong pour of disarano coke<br> 
            0.5g joint <span class="timestamp">11:20</span>pm<br>
            brought it to arcade<br> 
            valerian root - <span class="timestamp">5:00</span>am<br>
            smoked with moderately sized weed bowl<br>
            initial effects not feeling much- maybe a bit engeric but sort of just high<br><br> 

            <span class="timestamp">5:15</span><br><br>

            smoked it about 20/30 mins ago<br> 
            grinded up tablet and topped bong<br> 
            feel very fking sedated<br> 
            playing very nice trip music<br> 
            want to take another bowl of thr same as there’s still powder left and it stinks<br> 

            vision going weird sometimes<br> 
            going slightly pixilated rn, sort of creating fractals in thr bakcfounfs<br> 
            psychedelic music comes on as if in time<br> 
            massive urge to close my eyes<br>
            but i’m in the attic and want to do another bong whilst i’m in the attic<br> 
            think about it like dmt<br> 
            i feel like i’m tripping quite a bit rn but not like any trip i’ve experienced<br> 
            sort of like clonazpan mixed with h4 days sleep deprivation<br><br> 

            <span class="timestamp">5:21</span><br><br> 
            
            was gonna load up a bong before benefiting upstairs to bed<br> 
            but i think i’m gonna sprinkle some valerian on it<br>
            it just stinks so good<br> 
            i am also very hungry<br> 
            as soon as i stay still i become sedated by fingers move fine<br><br>

            <span class="timestamp">5:27</span><br><br>

            loaded the bong with the same amount of weed and valerian as last time<br> 
            it seems as if the longer i type i get sucked into partial paralysis<br> 
            i am going to hit this bing and attempt to get myself in bed asap<br> 

            <span class="timestamp">5:36</span><br><br>

            bong smoked<br> 
            made my way to toilet before piss<br> 
            whilst going upstairs from basement legs felt very similar to clonazepam 200mg + weed<br>
            urinatio good<br>
            looked at myself in mirror - i look absolutely freaking blazed<br><br> 

            spent about 5 mins swinging side to side in toilet door<br> 
            this seems to have changed font, not sure if it really has but it suits the music<br> 
            current tune :  feenicks szymon<br><br>

            <span class="timestamp">5:44</span><br><br>
            decied to take all weed stuff and root back down to basement<br> 
            was gonna take to my room but for some reason jusf room back<br><br> 

            which led me to the tapestry<br> 
            i talked to it out loud<br> 
            ‘it’s finally fucking happened, hasn’t it, i’ve reality hopped, i’m in a different reality’<br>
            took some pics of cool toes th<br> 
            eyes watering as uk wring. this<br>
            only right eye<br><br>


            <span class="timestamp">5:58</span><br><br>
            been in my room for awhile<br> 
            got my trousers and underwear off but just been arguing with horse head<br> 
            took another valerian in pill orally<br> 
            snaxks lined up in bed<br>
            feels slightly trippy but slightly delirious<br> 
            but not unpleasant<br><br> 

            colours seem more vivid for sure especially in my lights<br> 
            i find when i’m typing i’m unable to do althing else at the same time<br><br> 

            <span class="timestamp">6:04</span><br><br>

            in bed now<br> 
            opted for no top even tho it’s freezing<br> 
            got heater going full blast invaded in blanket<br> 
            mars bae heating up<br> 
            snacks by my side<br> 
            and extra eclairs<br> 
            the current music dexfjbed my feelings<br> 
            morning glory - desmond cheese<br>
            what a name lmao<br>
            goodnight<br><br>

            <span class="timestamp">6:09</span><br><br>

            had some very weird closed eye visuals<br> 
            similar to clonazepam + weed<br>
            but more animated<br>
            a lot of differnt coloured 4 point stars (isocelies)<br> 
            and anime cba cher from head view thrm looking. up many times<br> 
            eatintg chive and onion twists<br><br>

            thin thr oral tablet kicking in<br> 
            typing is a smaller field<br>
